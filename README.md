## Test the game

You can either test it [here](https://ixio.github.io/theogenesis/html5/index.html) or clone it (`git clone https://github.com/ixio/theogenesis`) and run `python3 -m http.server` in the html5 folder.

## Tech used:

* [Godot 3.2.1](https://godotengine.org/): game engine used to code and export to HTML5

## Audio tech:

* [eSpeak NG](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng): for audio effects (in particular `echo "City Converted" | espeak-ng -p 99 -g 12 -w assets/audio/conversion.wav`)
* [LMMS](https://lmms.io/): for the annoying music (hopefully a bit better than for LD42)
* [Pinta](https://pinta-project.com/pintaproject/pinta/): for the minimal (veering non-existant) graphics
